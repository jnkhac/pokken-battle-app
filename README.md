# **PokkenBattle**

## *What will the application do?*
*PokkenBattle* will be a turn-based game about battling a pokemon using a team of your pokemons.
From a list of available pokemons, you will be able to your by adding or removing pokemons as you see fit.
Once your team is set, you will be able to choose from a few different pokemons to battle.
During the battle, you will send out one pokemon from your team to battle the enemy.
You will be able to switch a pokemon in and out of the field as much as you like.
Your goal to win will be to use the pokemons from your team to attack the enemy pokemon until it faints 
(health reduced to 0). The opposing pokemon will also be able to attack back and do damage to your on-field pokemon.
You will lose the battle if one of your pokemon faints (health reduced to 0). You will also be able to tie if one of 
your pokemon and the enemy pokemon both faint at the same time. If you no longer want to battle you will be able to 
run away. After a battle (or by running away), your pokemon's health will be replenished so that they will be ready 
for the next battle.

## *Who will use it?*
Anyone interested in *Pokemon* or a strategy like game that involves team building and the managing of resources
(health in this case) will enjoy playing this game. The game may also be good for those who want to learn about the RPG
(Role-playing game) game genre since the battle mechanics and team building aspect in this game will be somewhat 
similar to what most RPG games offer.

## *Why is this project of interest to you?*
I wanted to make this project because I have been playing pokemon games since I was young and a turn-based game (or 
just any video game project) is a good way to challenge/motivate myself to learn more of the programming language to 
make it work. I also wanted to choose a project that is based on user interaction and real-time results because I 
want to be able to see instant feedback as soon as I do something (in this case it would be seeing the attack moves 
deplete the enemies' health bar). Pokemon games also have many attributes/types (ex. Fire, Water, Grass, etc.) which 
differentiates pokemons from each other. I had an idea about how this could be implemented in the future through 
abstract classes and using "extend". Overall, the topic is very broad and there are many ideas I could incorporate 
into it later without having to find workarounds or be limited due to it being about pokemon battles.

### Phase 4: Task 3
If I had more time to work on the project:
- I would have refactored the AttackMove class:
  - The class is currently being used for only one attack move (Tackle)
  - Class serves little purpose as there is no need for separate AttackMove from Pokemon if there is only one option
  - Refactoring the AttackMove class would require direct implementation of attack move into the Pokemon class 
    - Add 2 new fields to represent the attack name and attack damage
    - Refactoring removes an unnecessary class and simplifies UML by taking away the class and aggregation
  - BUT, I would keep it the way it is if I were to add more attack moves in the future
  
- I would have refactored the abstract Button class along with the classes that extended it:
  - The PokkenBattleAppGUI current has 24 nested classes
    - These classes represent the clickable buttons and a battle window for the game.
  - The cohesion is "okay" since the responsibility of the buttons, handlers, and the battle window are separated by 
  their individual classes.
  - The form of the class is bad because there are too many nested classes to manage and additional features in the 
  future will make the class even harder to manage down the line.
  - Refactoring the PokkenBattleAppGUI class would require separating the <<Abstract>> Button class and all the 
  other classes that extend it into their own individual classes. 
    - Change the input of certain constructors to take in this so that it can still access data in PokkenBattleAppGUI 
    instance like before.
    - Add getters and setters for the refactored classes to use. 
    - Refactoring cleans up the PokkenBattleAppGUI class and improve cohesion 
      - Buttons, handlers, and battle window classes are clearly split up with their own responsibilities.
